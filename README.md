# CatsDisadvantageMod

Ever wanted to be **WORSE** at the game?
well here you go lol... this can be used in publics since it doesn't fiddle with networking, doesn't give the player an advantage, and has no negative effects on the game in general, other than literally making it harder for the player.
## AA ltd stuff something idk
the mod is not under the devs or whatever... yeah nevermind.
